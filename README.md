Hello! this program is made for clustering a dataset automatically and avoid wasting time, because lots of clustering programs are alike.
Tips:
  1. You should do preprocessing and transforming categorical data to binary (OneHotEncode) yourself.
  2. You should make 2 datasets, 1-main dataset containing all data, 2-x dataset containing just columns that are used to train the model.
  3. Each time that you run this program, it automatically deletes data of previous run, so, be careful and backup your data.
  4. Make sure that you are on app folder in terminal when running code.

PCA:
  You can turn on pca, it transform all columns to 2 columns. It sometimes causes model performs better, the other reason to use it is the program can make a 2d plot for visualization.
